Hello World!
This is my first post in my blog! I spent hours on this blog engine, trying to think up a mechanism
for it to be able to run on a static page - and well, I did it!<br/>
Well... Let me tell you more about myself.<br/>
I am a 15-year-and-one-month-old, as of the time, with an interest in computer security, espectially hacking :).
Ever since three years ago, when I first assembled my own PC and got my hands on Linux (which I did not know what it was at the time) I couldn't stop programming.<br/>
I started with a few simple projects, then progressed to more advanced things, and before you know it, well, I went WAY above what was expected of me.
I do sometimes publish my code on Github - here is a link to my profile: <a href="https://github.com/id01">id01</a><br/>
Well, I don't really know what else to say... Any other teenage hackers around here? If so, shoot me a message on my website repo!<br/>
