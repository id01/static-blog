## The Static Blog
I made this static blog for my Github page, so... I decided to share it.  
No PHP or ASP, just HTML, CSS, and a LOT of javascript.  
This piece of code uses the Google CDN for jQuery.  
You must change the "path=/blog" occurances in readposts.js to the path of your choice and "compile" it to readposts.min.js first.  
Also, use content/addpost.sh to add a file to your blog.
